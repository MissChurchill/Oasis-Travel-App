# Oasis-Travel-App
My beta version of the travel app oasis

I created a useful mobile application using the features of Android and the concepts of software development that I learned in the prior phases of my Google Training Program.  This was a team project which a version of the app was created as a team, however, I built my own working beta version of the app implementing my independent creative control. In the team version, I contributed and led the integration of the Firebase Authentication with Google and email and password sign-in, Google Cloud Storage of photos and integration of accessing the phone's picture gallery to uploade photos to the cloud, and then taking that uploaded photo in the Cloud and returning in the main travel feed recyclerView. In my app version, I also added where the user can add the location and descriptsions of the photos uploaded.
